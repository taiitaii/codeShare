# codeShare

This is the full code for my CSCI 201 team's project, codeShare. CodeShare is a Java web app that allows users to write and compile code simultaneously; think Google Docs, but for coding. My role was more in the backend/SQL area, but I also helped with the HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend; visit amanosmerling.com/codeShare.html to learn more!
